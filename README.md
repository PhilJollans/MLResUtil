# MLResUtil
COM component to read and write binary resource files in the .RES format

This project was originally part of my MultiLanguage AddIn for VB6. It enabled me to read and write binary .RES files from a VB6 program.

It is an ATL/COM C++ project, probably created with Visual Studio version 6.0, but I'm pretty sure it compiles with all version, up to Visual Studio 2022.
